Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

### Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It
should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers.
If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to
a different provider without affecting your customers.

Example Email Providers:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/) - [Developer Hub](https://developers.sparkpost.com/)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html)

All listed services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so
please register your own test accounts on each.

Technical spec
--------------

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for
instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other
technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is
respected.

Choose **one** of the following technical tracks that best suits your skillset:

1. **Back-end track**: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API
   docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other
   services.

### Back-end

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about
using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.
Therefore, feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have
with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing
your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Go
* C++
* Haskell
* Java

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework
that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

Host it!
--------

When you’re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).
